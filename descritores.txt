---glrlm_RunLengthNonUniformityNormalized
RLN measures the similarity of run lengths throughout the image, with a lower value indicating more homogeneity among run lengths in the image.

--- glrlm_RunPercentage
RP measures the coarseness of the texture by taking the ratio of number of runs and number of voxels in the ROI.
Values are in range 1Np≤RP≤1, with higher values indicating a larger portion of the ROI consists of short runs (indicates a more fine texture)

---glrlm_ShortRunEmphasis
SRE is a measure of the distribution of short run lengths, with a greater value indicative of shorter run lengths and more fine textural textures.

---glrlm_LongRunEmphasis
LRE is a measure of the distribution of long run lengths, with a greater value indicative of longer run lengths and more coarse structural textures.

glrlm_RunVariance
RV is a measure of the variance in runs for the run lengths.
